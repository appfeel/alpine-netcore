# Alpine netcore

Alpine image with netcore installed.

To use it create a dotnet-dll.yml with like this:

```yml
version: "3.7"
services:
    dotnet-svc:
        image: appfeel/alpine-netcore:latest
        volumes: /var/dotnet-volume:/mnt/dll
        working_dir: /mnt/dll
        command: "/bin/dotnet-sdk/dotnet mydll.dll"
```

This configuration assumes that you have your dll files inside a folder named `/var/dotnet-volume` in your host machine. To wake up your dll run from command line:

```bash
docker-compose dotnet-dll.yml up
```

And voil√†! You'll have your Microsoft .NET application running inside docker.
